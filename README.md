# Deep-Learning-Model-for-ECG-based-Sleep-Apnea-Detection
In this project, we used single-lead ECG data along with cutting-edge machine learning and deep 
learning approaches to identify sleep apnea. The objective was to evaluate these strategies 
objectively by contrasting their performance on physioNet dataset. We created a model with 
distinct training, validation, and test sets for in-depth analysis using Python and Flask.  It was 
observed that deep learning models outperform conventional machine learning techniques. Based 
on the achieved results, the use of hybrid deep neural networks is recommended for sleep apnea 
detection from ECG
